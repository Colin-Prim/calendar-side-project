Driving home from school the other day, I became curious whether some calendar days are more prone to fall on certain weekdays (e.g. is Jan 4th more likely to be on a Thursday than a Sunday?)
	This program will analyze data from previous centuries and determine the probability that a given calendar day would fall on a given day of the week.
